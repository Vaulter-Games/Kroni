**KRONI**

KRONI is a first person arena shooter that is heavily inspired by games such as Halo, Doom,

Quake, and Destiny. It will consist of two parts: a story-driven campaign, and a multiplayer

section. I will explain the different aspects of the game in detail in this document.

**Core Mechanics**

Here are the core mechanics:

Movement - your base movement speed will be quite fast, and there will be no sprint; it will not

be necessary. You will be able to crouch, jump, etc, all the usual movement capabilities, and

crouching while moving will cause you to slide in that direction. The player may have other

movement abilities available; for example, an idea I considered was the ability to suddenly

dodge to the left or right very quickly by pressing Q or E, respectively. The goal for the

movement is to make it feel similarly to a mix of Doom or Quake, and Destiny.

Weaponry - you will be able to equip two weapons at a given time, and there will be weapons

around the map or dropped by enemies that you will be able to pick up. To acquire ammo for a

certain weapon, you must pick up another instance of that weapon by standing on/near it. There

will be a large focus on weapon sandbox, with different classes of weapons based on range and

damage output, and each faction in the game will have its own unique suite of weapons.

Abilities - you will have magical abilities available to you in some parts of the campaign, and

possibly in some multiplayer modes. I am not 100% sure what form these abilities will take

currently and I am open to suggestions. However, I had the idea of having grenade and melee

abilities that you can unlock and equip, similar to destiny. There will be many different varieties

of these abilities you can equip to help the sandbox feel varied. Throughout the campaign you

will be able to unlock these abilities as you complete levels and perhaps through finding secret

collectibles as well, and using the xp from finding these to advance an ability tree. Abilities

higher in the campaign tree will be more powerful to reward player progression.

If abilities end up being in multiplayer modes, they will start off all unlocked so no player

has an unfair advantage. They will also be balanced in power to make the sandbox feel fair,

unlike the campaign. In pve coop modes, players will start with their abilities. In pvp modes,

players may start with abilities or have to pick them up from the map depending on the mode.

Enemies - There will be a wide variety of enemies with different behaviors, health levels, loadout

possibilities, etc, similarly to Halo or Doom. The player(s) will have to employ a variety of

different tactics to defeat different enemies and combinations of enemies. In combat, cover will

be sparse; however, the attacks of enemies will be designed to be dodgeable, and thanks to

your fast movement speed, the combat loop will consist of lots of strafing and dodging in order

to stay alive.





Mission Mechanics - In campaign missions and pve coop missions, there will be a set of

mechanics the player must figure out and execute, similar to a raid in Destiny, with the

exception that the campaign mechanics are designed to be completed solo. Each mission will

have its own set of mechanics exclusive to it, and will have a series of encounters. Each

encounter will involve arena-style combat you’d expect from a Doom game, in addition to the

special mechanics the player must figure out. The first encounter will be relatively simple, but

each encounter will add more mechanics and become more complex and challenging to

complete, culminating in a final encounter that may involve some kind of boss. The mechanics

of each mission will be informed by the themes of the setting and enemies of that mission.

Specifically in the campaign, the final mission will incorporate the mechanics of all prior

missions, culminating in a final boss battle. Pve coop modes will require teamwork and

communication to complete, but will likely only have a small number of encounters compared to

campaign missions, and will probably have very similar mechanics to those found in the

campaign.

Difficulty Slider - There will be 4 difficulty modes: Story, Normal, Hard, and Legendary. The

things affected by the difficulty slider will be things like AI intelligence and accuracy, how hard it

is to dodge their projectiles, and the forgiveness of mission mechanics. I would like to avoid

things like increasing enemy health or damage, as I think that is not as fun as simply facing off a

more intelligent opponent. Granted, adjusting AI intelligence may be more difficult to implement,

and so I am open to changing this.

**Single-Player Campaign**

The main function of this campaign will be to set the stage for the game’s world and setting; in

other words, its primary task is world building. To accomplish this, the main character will start

the game unable to remember any prior events. The starting level will be the wreckage of some

facility, and it will be semi-open world similar to Halo 3: ODST (don’t be worried, this “open

world” will be quite small in scale). It will consist of many different rooms and enemy encounters

that you can visit in any order, and you will search the map for different artifacts to jog your

memory by triggering a flashback mission. In each flashback mission, you will be accompanied

by a squad of highly trained soldiers.

The open world mission will be less mechanically complex than the flashback missions,

but you will also not have your abilities in the flashback missions. Therefore, the focus on the

encounters in the open-world mission will be more about exploring and using your abilities

instead of learning mission mechanics. The enemies you will face In the open world mission will

primarily be Krall and Demons.

At this point I plan on having 4 flashback missions that take place at different moments

of time. I will list them here:

Recollection - This mission introduces the events directly prior to the destruction of the facility

you find yourself in. You learn that you are a highly specialized soldier of the Azellian Republic,

and you are at war with the Krall Empire. You were sent on a top secret mission to infiltrate a





facility where the Krall were experimenting with demonic ritual magic, and throughout the

mission you fight your way through various rooms and face off against Krall wizards and mages,

among other Krall enemies. However, you arrive too late, and at the end of the mission, they

successfully summon a demon, with disastrous effects; the blast of energy produced by the

portal is what destroyed the facility. However, something extremely important happens in this

moment: by some freak accident, a sliver of an incredibly powerful extra-dimensional being

somehow slipped through the portal and infused itself with the main character. This is how the

main character survives the blast, and is also where their magical abilities come from.

Cabal - In this mission, the player learns more about the war and the Krall. It takes place further

back in time, and in it, the main character is tasked with infiltrating a citadel fleet of the Krall

called Cabal. The primary objective of this mission is to take out the fleet and defeat the

high-ranking Krall admiral named Pollux. However, in this mission, you also find intelligence

about the facility you enter in Recollection. Throughout this mission, you battle through waves of

Krall enemies to gain access to Cabal’s core reactor, overload the reactor and rig it to blow, and

then face off against Pollux in a boss battle.

Suppression - In this mission, the player learns more about the Azellian Republic, its history,

and its internal politics. It takes place even further back in the timeline on an Azellian controlled

planet, where a rebellion against their rule is taking place. The revolt is being led by a group of

Hakoras, who’s nationalist zeal leads them to desire independence from the Azellian Republic.

The Republic sends you and your squad to infiltrate and put down the rebellion, and as such

you are mainly fighting Hakoran enemies in this mission. You are restricted to non-lethal

weapons for most of the mission, but at the end you are instructed to kill the orchestrators of the

rebellion to make an example of them. In a cutscene, the main character is unable to kill them,

and lowers their weapon as they watch their squadmates pull the trigger. This is meant to show

that, while the Krall Empire is unambiguously evil, perhaps the Azellian Republic is not in the

right either.

Kroni - In this mission, the player learns more about magic, how it works, its place in Azellian

culture, and its place in the war. Kalfan, a Hakoran military leader, is secretly developing Project

Kroni, in which they are utilizing magic to create magical weaponry and use it in the war against

the Krall. “Kroni” is the Azellian word for perversion, and they indeed find the use of magic for

violence to be a perversion. The main character and their squad will be one of the first Kroni

Infiltration Units to be formed by this project, and the player will test these magical weapons by

facing off against demons held captive by Kalfan’s wizards.

After completing every flashback mission, the player will be able to find a ship to escape the

destroyed facility and make their way into space. In space, they will infiltrate a Krall cruiser

overrun by Demons after engaging in a dogfight in space. This will be the last mission of the

game, and once on the ship, they will fight through hordes of demons, attempt to set of the

ship’s reactor to destroy the ship, and make their way to the Demon Lord summoned at the end

of Recollection in order to defeat them in the final boss fight. The mechanics in this mission will





be the most complex in the game, and will combine mechanics from previous missions. In terms

of story and world building, the player will learn more about demons, where they come from,

and the threat they pose to the universe in this mission.

The campaign story will be told through a combination of dialogue, environmental

storytelling, a minimal amount of cutscenes, and lore entries. Our ability to make cutscenes will

probably be limited, but hopefully we can make at least a couple. In each mission, there will be

many hidden collectibles scattered throughout. Most of these will likely be lore entries, but some

may progress the ability tree, and others may be easter eggs.

This campaign is intended to be short and limited in scope, as our resources and

capabilities will likely be limited. It is only 6 missions long, and that may mean it will not take

long to complete. On the other hand, the complex mission mechanics may increase its length

due to players having to figure out and execute the mechanics.

**Multiplayer**

KRONI’s multiplayer will be split into two parts: Arena pvp and Cooperative pve.

Arena pvp - This mode is pretty much a classic arena shooter mode. You start out with two

mediocre mid-range weapons, and you must scour the map for more powerful weapons as you

face off against your opponents. There will also be several different game modes, such as team

deathmatch, capture the flag, free for all, etc, all the usual arena modes. However, there would

also be certain modes regarding magical abilities. For example, in some modes, you have to

pick up abilities on the map, just like weapons. However, in others, you start out with your

abilities, and you can pick your ability loadout prior. Perhaps there are still other modes where

players can use their abilities incredibly frequently, or maybe can’t use abilities at all. It

ultimately depends on what we have time to implement.

Cooperative pve - This mode is somewhat similar to Halo’s firefight, but with a twist: it has

mechanics similar to campaign missions, except they require multiple players to execute, and

the team must cooperate and communicate. To fit the theme of Kroni Infiltration Units, these

mechanics will often involve the player infiltrating some sort of Krall base. These missions may

have some sort of story implications as well. Another mode that could possibly be implemented

is a pvevp mode, where two teams must fight AI as well as fighting or competing with each

other. These could perhaps take the form of an Azellian side and a Krall side. Finally, one last

mode that could be implemented is a mode called Incursion, where players must fight off waves

of demons. I am not sure if we will have the time or resources to implement all of these

however, and if we end up having to cut content, these coop pve modes will be the first to go.

Customization - Of course, the multiplayer side of this game will have customization. Players will

be able to play as any of the races shown in game - Azelles, Krall, Hakoras, Umtshini - and

each race has its own armor sets that you will also be able to customize. There will be

unlockable weapon skins as well, and perhaps we can change the color of magical abilities.





All customization will be unlockable without spending a single penny. There probably

won't be any micro-transactions, but if for some reason we decide to have them, they will be

extremely optional and players will still be able to unlock anything just by playing.

**Background Lore and Story**

The lore of the game will primarily be delivered through lore entries found in the campaign and

possibly on some multiplayer maps, but perhaps some will be able to be gleaned through the

campaign or environmental storytelling.

The game is set in the Andromeda Galaxy, and is about twenty thousand years in the

future. There are no humans in this game, although they do exist in the universe, and will be

explored in later games and stories. The story starts with the Azelles, a race of blue-skinned

humanoids native to a jungle planet. Their homeworld was extremely lush and abundant with

live, and because of this, scarcity was essentially non-existent. For most of their existence, the

Azelles lived rather anarchically, and found ways to develop advanced technologies without

exploiting the environment to harmful degrees, usually by way of magic. This had a huge

influence on their culture, and concepts of violence and even abuse were quite alien to them.

However, this all changed when they discovered the technology necessary for interstellar travel.

As the Azelles explored the galaxy, they eventually discovered other sentient life forms.

However, they were horrified by what they found. Many of the societies they encountered had

very hierarchical social organization, which led to exploitation, violence, and artificial scarcity.

Many of these creatures would deal each other great harm for reasons the Azelles could not

comprehend, and they felt they must do something to help these creatures.The first two species

they encountered, the Hakoras and the Umptshini, were relatively unadvanced technologically.

Because of this, the Azelles we able to find ways to easily pacify or incapacitate the violent

members of these species, and they went to work dismantling their governments and societies.

In doing this, they formed what would eventually be called the Azellian Republic, and placed

themselves in a position of authority over these “ethically impure” races. Although the Azelles

meant well, they had unknowingly started down a path which would lead them to become the

very things they hated about these other races.

The Azellian Republic continued to expand, and Hakoras and Umptshini who did not

engage in violent behavior were allowed to partake in the luxuries and standard of living enjoyed

by the Azelles. However, most Azelles regarded them with suspicion and distrust, which led

them to have feelings of resentment. Eventually, groups of Hakoras and Umptshini would start

revolting against Azellian rule, and, blind to their own hypocrisy, the Azelles would incapacitate

the rebels and institute them in re-educational facilities. This only escalated tensions between

the different species, and as these tensions rose, the Republic only grew more authoritarian.

However, before these tensions could erupt, the Azelles encountered another galactic power to

rival them. This was the Krall Empire, and they were far crueler than the Azelles.

The Krall Empire was vast, and purged many of the thousands of sentient species that

had once populated the Andromeda Galaxy in their reign. To put it bluntly, they were fascists,

and even within their own species, they would purge or enslave anyone who they deemed to be





“degenerate” in nature. Alien species only had it worse, with the Krall seeing them as little more

than vermin blocking their path towards greatness.

While the Azelles had formed a small military force to control the Hakoras and

Umptshini, they had restricted themselves to only using non-lethal weapons, and they paled in

comparison to the military might of the Krall Empire. The Krall had no such qualms with dealing

out death, and the Azelles knew they would not be able to engage them in traditional warfare.

They attempted using guerilla tactics, and while they did offer some success, they found

themselves consistently outmatched by the hardware and violent use of magic employed by the

Krall. Many Hakoras and Umptshini pointed out that the magical prowess of the Azelles was far

greater than that of the Krall, and suggested they use it to create magical weaponry and train

mage warriors. However, magic was quite sacred in Azellian culture, and the prospect of using it

to wage war was incredibly offensive to them. They saw it as a perversion, and began using

“kroni” as a slur against all who would put forth such a perverted suggestion. However, there

were a small number of younger Azelles who were born after the war had started who were a

bit more open minded. A prominent Hakoran figure named Kalfan knew this, and began to form

a secret movement known as Project Kroni to use magic to develop weapons and troops to use

against the Krall. Many of these younger Azelles joined him, in addition to many Hakoras and

Umptshini. In this effort, they created and trained highly specialized squadrons known as Kroni

Infiltration Units. They tested these units by summoning and containing hordes of demons, and

having the units face off against them. They Proved to be devastating, with individual soldiers

acting almost as one-man armies. They then began secret missions infiltrating Krall bases, and

the results were incredible. A single squadron was able to clear out an entire base of hostiles.

By sending a few thousand squadrons to a planet, they could destroy most of the Krall’s

fortifications, and all that was needed was to then send in a small fleet to establish control over

the planet. The squadrons could even infiltrate Krall fleets, allowing them to take out large

portions of the Krall navy without ever having to engage in naval combat. Finally, they were able

to deploy them extremely quickly in huge numbers, and they were able to create a huge guerilla

offensive before the Krall had any time to react. This left them demoralized and on the

defensive, buying Project Kroni the time to develop magical superweapons to equip their ships

with. Now, with far superior firepower and lethality, they finally had the ability to confront the

Krall head on. Because of Project Kroni, the Azellian Republic was able to win the war.

However, this was not without consequences. Azellian culture was not ready for this, and

when Project Kroni was inevitably discovered, Azellian society had a visceral reaction. For the

very first time in the history of the Azelles as a species, they condemned someone to death.

Kalfan, who was blamed for all of Project Kroni, was executed by lethal injection. This was a

pivotal moment for Azellian society. They justified this act by proclaiming if Kalfan did not value

life, they should not value his; unbeknownst to them at the time, they would later use this very

reasoning to justify all the atrocities they would later commit. The worst part is that the Republic

would continue to use and even fund Project Kroni. They would even, quite ironically, eventually

use Kroni Infiltration Units to put down revolts against their rule and execute their leaders. While

they eventually triumphed over the Krall, they did so at a terrible cost, and by the end of the war,

the Republic was barely held together by a thread.





Towards the end of the war, the Krall grew desperate, and began experimenting with

demonic ritual magic. However, they did not understand the gravity of the forces they were

playing with, and inadvertently transformed an entire continent into a wasteland. The Demon

Lord that rose from these ashes grew an army, and set out presumably to conquer other worlds.

A Kroni Infiltration Unit had been sent to stop this ritual, but had been unsuccessful;

miraculously, one of the members of this unit had survived, and managed to somehow single

handedly defeat the Demon Lord before it got far. When they returned, they were examined by

some Azellian wizards, and they discovered they had been infused with some sort of cosmic

energy. This energy seemed to be a part of some inter-dimensional being, and was incredibly

potent with arcane power, but they weren’t able to discern much else. Apparently, some

demons had remained, and occasionally nearby planets would suffer from demonic incursions;

thankfully, Kroni Infiltration Units were able to make short work of them.

When the Krall Empire finally fell, they were integrated into the Azellian Republic just as

the Hakoras and Umptshini had been. However, the Krall received much harsher treatment than

the other species under the Azelles’ jurisdiction, and part of this was because Azellian Society

had somewhat been desensitized to violence over the course of the war. Many Krall saw the

Demon Lord that had been summoned as a martyr, and began worshipping demons as symbols

of strength. This began the plague of demonic cults that would incessantly pester the Azellian

Republic for essentially the remainder of its existence. However, the minds of many of these

fools would eventually be preyed on by far more frightening beings.

There are many other concepts in the lore I would like to discuss. I will list them here:

Magic, Demons, and Related Concepts

In the space between universes and planes, there is a mass of swirling nothing, a void of roiling

energy. This is known as the Maelstrom, and it is the source of all magic. Sentient lifeforms can,

for some reason, create imprints in the Maelstrom, and, in some cases, manipulate it. The

strongest of minds can even shape this energy according to their desires, and this is how one

can cast spells. By using one’s mind to shape the energies of the Maelstrom, and then pull them

into their dimension, they can manipulate the world around them in fantastical or even terrifying

ways. However, this is not without dangers. The Maelstrom is incredibly volatile, and the

untrained mind can end up unleashing energies they cannot control; in doing so, a range of

effects of varying severity can occur, from merely dying to ceasing to exist entirely, but almost

all such effects are fatal. Various different cultures have developed many different rituals and

meditations designed to calm, clear, and focus one’s mind in order to avoid these disastrous

side effects.

Demons are beings that are carved from the energies of the Maelstrom by magic users.

They are not necessarily evil, and *in theory*, one could create a perfect being by performing this

technique. However, in practice, this is almost impossible, with even the most skilled wizards

only able to create crude mockeries of things from their world. That said, these demons are at

least not malevolent, but the same cannot be said for demons created by less skilled casters.

This is because, while the physical form of a demon is relatively (emphasis on relatively) not as

difficult to create, creating a mind is absurdly difficult, especially regarding the intricacies of





empathy, compassion, and emotion in general. The result is that anyone short of legendary skill

will more than likely create horrible beings that lay waste to all in their path. These horrors range

from mindless beasts to scheming hyper-intelligences, but they are invariably incredibly

dangerous. Because of this, most wizards would recommend not even entertaining the idea of

demon summoning, but unfortunately, other malevolent forces can compel weak minds to do

foolish things with disastrous consequences.

Speaking of malevolent forces, there are some beings in the universe that possess

tremendous magical ability beyond what any mortal could achieve. There is not much known

about such beings, other than when encountered, they illicit what can only be described as

cosmic horror. These beings are not necessarily malevolent, but that is only because they don’t

have much regard for lower lifeforms in general, treating us as little more than ants to be

exterminated in preparation for some unknowable goal. These beings will be explored in future

Kroni games and stories.

The Maelstrom is mostly just a swirling void of energy, but there are in fact some beings

that reside there. These beings are utterly incomprehensible, beyond the cognition of any mortal

being, and if they can be said to be sentient, it is utterly unlike anything we know of. These

beings are occasionally responsible for the creation of entire universes, only for those universes

to later be destroyed as they are caught between the unknowable conflicts these beings

sometimes have with each other. Most magic users have no way of even being aware of these

entities, but if they somehow are, communicating with them turns out to be an astronomically

impossible feat. In order to do so, you would need to cast a demonic ritual pulling from a point in

the Maelstrom where one of these beings is currently residing, which essentially just comes

down to luck, and given that the Maelstrom is infinite and these beings are finite, the probability

of this being successful is astronomically low. Incredibly, the Krall who summoned the Demon

Lord in KRONI managed to get that lucky, and now the protagonist of KRONI is infused with one

of these beings. The decidedly unfortunate consequences of this will be explored in future Kroni

games and stories.

The Sentient Species in Kroni

Here I will list a description of the appearance, culture, and history of each of the species in

KRONI:

Azelles - Lithe blue humanoids native to the lush green planet of Tiro, which orbits a red dwarf.

They are usually between 5’7” and 6’9”, are rather lean and elegant, and usually weigh between

160 lbs and 230 lbs. They have dark blue stripes on their face that go through their eyes, and

their eyes are an even darker blue. They can have skin colors of many different shades of blue,

but their stripes and eyes are always darker. Rarely, they can have different skin colors other

than blue, with their stripes and eyes being a darker shade of that color, but they are almost

always pastel colors such as pinks and blue-greens and purples. The hair follicles on their

heads are very thick, almost as thick as a porcupine spine, but they are just as flexible as

normal hair. They can live for hundreds of years, but they only take around twenty to reach

adulthood. They are very agile and dexterous. They are also herbivores.





Their homeworld of Tiro is a heavily forested planet, with vegetation abundant. As one

nears the equator, the trees begin to thin out and vast grassy plains with large herds of animals

grazing the bright green grass. The planet rotates in a very strange manner, resulting in the

sun’s energy being somewhat equally distributed across the surface of the planet. This results in

a relatively cool climate, allowing plantlife to run rampant. Because of the abundance of plants,

animal life can reach absurd populations without overpopulation being a problem. Oddly, there

is a large lack of natural predators, and almost all living creatures are very peaceful. The

Azelles, like most animals, evolved to be very compassionate and caring for one another,

resulting in massive and complex networks of mutual aid and economic interaction that utterly

lack societal hierarchy; this may be called anarchy by humans. This also results in their

abhorrence of violence, and in fact they did not know living things were capable of harming each

other until they encountered alien life. The incredibly complex and networked distribution of their

economy allows for incredibly efficient supply chains, which affords them a very high standard of

living in addition to a highly intelligent and curious populace. Being very curious creatures, their

culture is also very focused on discovery, making their science and philosophy develop rapidly.

Since food is so abundant, Tiro also has a tremendous population of 20 billion.

Tiro is roughly twice the size of Earth. Tiro also has two moons, Farlem and Dingar, the

former of which is terraformed and both of which are colonized. The other planets in their solar

system are Sindar, a small rock planet with no atmosphere that is closest to the sun; Vulcon, a

planet similar to Mars that is colonised and currently in the process of being terraformed;

Bulbon, a gas giant with 41 moons, one of which is suspected to have an ocean under the

surface containing life, although they have not drilled through the crust in fear of hurting the life;

and finally Faldem, a distant ice giant with 17 moons. In between Vulcon and Bulbon is an

asteroid belt where many successful mining operations have been established, and there is a

kuiper belt beyond Faldem with many Pluto-sized objects. The Azelles get most of their metals

from the asteroid belt and mining operations on Dingar.

The minds of the Azelles evolved in a strange fashion that made them unusually

susceptible to maelstrom energies, allowing them to become mages and wizards much easier

than other species. All of the best wizards in the galaxy are Azelles, and countless citizens of

the Azellian Republic of all species flock to Azellian magical academies. However, they only

used this magic for peaceful means up until the Krall War. Post-Krall War, Azellian ideas about

violence and whether magic should be used for it have changed tremendously, and both have

become more acceptable.

Hakoras - Insectile humanoids native to the planet Slivak, approximately 45 light years away

from Tiro. They evolved from large hive-minded insects, and although they are not hive-minded,

they inherited this trait in the form of intense tribalism resulting in nearly fanatic nationalism in

their societies; to be clear, they are not necessarily biologically inclined towards tribalism, but

their cultural development was informed by they evolution from hive-minded insects. Because of

this, they are constantly at war with each other, and they have not been able to develop beyond

the medieval age due to this constant violence. The arrival of the Azelles was culturally

devastating, with some fearing the end times and others worshipping them as gods, and some

still worship the Azelles to this day.





Hakoras are carnivorous, and must consume copious amounts of insects in order to

sustain themselves. They can live up to 90 years of age, although most didn’t live past 45

before they were assimilated into the Azellian Republic. However, they mature into adulthood at

the very quick rate of 10 years, which is why they are commonly used as ground troops by the

Mantle. They stand between 4’9'' and 6’0” at adulthood, and typically weigh from 120-200 lbs.

They have strange, insectile faces, with a strange roundish maw and many black beady eyes,

as well as antennae and many small horns adorning the tops of their heads. Their legs are

similar to grasshopper legs, allowing them to jump tremendous heights, but their arms are not

too different from a normal humanoid other than only having three fingers. Their

exoskeleton-like “skin” typically comes in various shades of brown, although they do have

skeletons.

Their home planet of Slivak is tidally locked, with one side being a scorched desert and

the other being trapped in an eternal blizzard, with a slim strip of life along the equator stuck in

eternal dusk. Slivak orbits a medium-sized yellow star, not different from the humans’ Sun; it is

the only rock planet in the solar system, with a many-mooned (some of which were terraformed

by the Republic) gas giant named Flongu, and three ice giants called Cyndo, Gorm, and Wol.

There is no asteroid belt to speak of, but there is of course a kuiper belt and an oort cloud

beyond the ice giants.

Umtshini - Stout mountain dwelling people native to Entabeni that closely resemble Dwarves(an

evolutionary descendant of humans). These creatures were, when they were discovered by the

Azelles, unfortunately cursed with an economic system that humans would call laissez-faire

capitalism. While most of their population slaved away in factories and mines within abhorrent

working conditions, an extremely powerful minority held an obscene amount of wealth due to

the property relations within their society, and a powerful state protected those property “rights”

by violently suppressing rebellions, strikes, and workers unions. They, unlike the Hakoras, had

developed much better technology due to the incessant growth of this system, and have

terraformed and/or exploited the resources of many of the other planets and objects within their

solar system. They also had very advanced weaponry. Luckily, many of the evils of this system

have been eradicated by the Azellian Republic due to the forced collectivization of resources

enforced by an Azellian state.

Umtshini are rather short compared to other humanoids, typically being around 4’5”-5’4”;

however, they are very bulky and stocky, typically weighing around 170-290 lbs due to their

muscle mass. However, due to their hierarchical society, the poorer Umtshini weighed around

120-150 lbs due to malnourishment before assimilation into the Republic. Their skin is very thick

and tough, and is colored in various shades of grey. It is very difficult to cut through their coarse

skin, which is almost an inch thick. Their eyes are one solid color, similarly to Azelles, although

they are usually various shades of blue and green. They have very thick hair and beards, which

they pride themselves on. They also have very large and strong teeth, which they use to grind

rocks into powder in order to acquire the minerals they need to survive. They acquire proteins

and sugars from the strange cave-dwelling fungi native to Entabeni.

Their home planet of Entabeni is extremely tectonically active, resulting in a surface

ridden with mountains and plateaus, as well as frequent earthquakes. The largest bodies of





water on the planet are massive underwater lakes. It has a very hostile climate, and Azellian

scientists are still not quite sure how life was able to evolve on it. It has one moon called

Inyanga that was terraformed into a paradise for the wealthy to live in. It orbits a massive blue

giant, and the two other planets in the solar system are a massive gas giant that orbits very

close to the star called Elivuthayo and another rocky planet that was too cold for life to evolve

called Ngxondorha. Ngxondorha was terraformed into another paradise for the rich, and

Elivuthayo’s many moons were exploited for resources. Beyond Ngxondorha is a massive

asteroid belt that eventually blends into the kuiper belt that was exploited for resources.

Krall - Lithe reptilian creatures with large toothy maws native to the planet Krokan. Prior to the

Republic’s victory in the Krall War, they had a massive galactic empire controlled by a fascistic

government. The historical development of their society was rather similar to earlier human

civilizations; with the advent of the agricultural revolution, societal hierarchies began emerging,

and over time their societies grew more and more authoritarian. Eventually they reached a

system humans might call capitalism, and of course, many poorer Krall grew unhappy with

these conditions. Unfortunately, as is typical for those in power, the ruling class of Krall society

turned to oppressed Krall ethnicities to scapegoat, and it worked. A charismatic leader named

Krix from a Krall nation whose name is lost to time rose to power on a platform of national pride

and a return to an idealized past. Various stigmatized ethnicities and sexual deviants were

scapegoated, and were blamed for the “degeneration” of Krall society. Once in power, Krix got

to work sending these “degenerates” to forced labor camps, where they would produce

weaponry for their military that they would use to conquer the rest of Krokan. As they conquered

more of the Krall homeworld, their ideology shifted to one focused on the pride of their species,

with scapegoated ethnicities being falsely labeled as not “true” Krall. Sexual deviants were

framed as traitors for not producing offspring for the Krall race. Eventually they discovered the

key to interstellar travel, and went to work expanding their influence throughout the galaxy,

genociding any sentient race they came across. This continued until They were finally defeated

in their war with the Azellian Republic.

Fortunately, the Krall Empire was not universally accepted by the Krall living under it.

Underground resistance and even full-on insurrection was a regular occurrence, and the

Empire’s brute force attempts at suppressing this resistance were futile. To be frank, it’s quite

the miracle that the Krall empire lasted as long as it did, as their primary tactic for controlling it’s

populace was fear and violence - tactics that usually aren’t very effective. During the war, the

republic would frequently get assistance from or fight alongside Krall rebels, and they were very

important for many war efforts. Unfortunately, this wasn’t really recognized at the end of the war,

with most Azelles generalizing Krall as barbaric warmongers.

Krall are of comparable height to Azelles, and have tough scaly skin shaded in various

grays and browns and whites, and rarely, silver as well. Only silver- and certain gray-colored

Krall are considered “ethnically pure” by the Krall Empire. They are hardy and formidable, and

typically weigh between 170-250 lbs. Their heads are strange, round, and eyeless, and are

mostly mouth. They detect their surroundings with highly advanced sonar that is so precise that

it may as well be vision, explaining their massive maws.They have sharp claws on both their

four-fingered hands and feet.





Their native planet of Krokan is similar to Earth, with vast oceans and several continents

with varied landscapes. It orbits a yellow star, and there are 5 other planets that orbit it: three

rocky planets named Gog, Krak, and Sik that are all closer to the star than Krokan and are all

too hot to sustain life; and two gas giants named Hu and Foz. Several of Hu’s and Foz’s moons

have been terraformed by the Krall. The kuiper belt and oort cloud are often exploited for

resources by the Krall.

Other Andromedean Species - There were once many more species of humanoids within the

Andromeda Galaxy, but unfortunately almost all of them were genocided to extinction by the

Krall Imperium. A small few were rescued from Krall labor camps, and remain under close

protection by the Azellian Republic, such as the Yoi and the Wunai, but they are very close to

extinction with at most only around 500 million of them left.

That pretty much sums up the lore relevant to the first Kroni game. However, there is lots more

that can be explored in future Kroni content. For example, the humans will become relevant in

the second Kroni game.

**Future Plans**

Kroni is intended to be the first in a trilogy of games. I recognize we should focus our efforts on

simply making and releasing a game first and foremost, but I have many long term goals that I

think would be good to keep in the back of our minds. This first Kroni game is meant to lay the

groundwork of an entire world, and hopefully, this will enable us to create lots of other Kroni

content in the future. I will start by briefly explaining the basic story concepts for the next two

installments in the trilogy:

\-

The second Kroni game will take place a significant amount of time after the first one.

The Azellian Republic has expanded into some of the galaxies near the Milky Way,

bringing numerous species under their jurisdiction. As they begin expanding into the

Milky Way, they come into conflict with yet another evil space empire; yes, the humans

have a galaxy-spanning fascist empire that the Azellian republic is now at war with.

During this war, they discover an incredibly ancient ruin filled with incomprehensible

technology, and the Kroni protagonist, who has inexplicably survived through the

centuries, is sent to wrest control of it from the humans. Events with cosmic

consequences ensue, and the humans capture Kroni guy to discover the cosmic energy

infused in them; this has terrible consequences, and the inter-planar beings I mentioned

in the lore section of this document start coming into play.

\-

The third Kroni game takes place after these events; the human-Azelle war seems to be

never ending, and occasionally incursions from a cosmic being will occur and swallow up

entire planets, with only Kroni guy and some other people with cosmic powers who have

started popping up able to do anything about it. In addition, the pandemic of demonic

cults has come to a pinnacle: it turns out that some sort of lovecraftian intelligence has





been manipulating people from afar to constantly form these cults and summon demons

all the time. It has in fact been doing this for tens of thousands of years, and one of

these cults was responsible for the initial downfall of human civilization, prior to it’s

reformation into the empire it is now; this cult, composed of creatures that were once

human called Orcs, has emerged from the shadows after thousands of years, and it

goes around killing everyone and worshipping elder gods. They herald the arrival of a

lovecraftian fleet from unknown origins, and terrible incomprehensible creatures rain

down on the Republic’s planets. Only Kroni guy stands any chance of preventing this

tide from washing over the Republic.

In addition to this trilogy, I have a concept for a fourth game that takes place after the third, and

is very ambitious in scope. I understand this may sound unrealistic, perhaps what I have laid out

previously already sounds unrealistic, but just hear me out. The concept of this game is an

mmorpg fps where, after the events of the Kroni trilogy, individuals infused with the same

cosmic power that Kroni guy has have started popping up constantly. The characters players

play as are these people. In this game, there will be a faction system where you can essentially

create your own empire; however, it can in practice fill the role anything, from being a simple

player clan, to being a kind of pirate guild or something similar, to being a full on nation or

country, to being a sort of anarchic association. To grow these, you must recruit NPCs and

other players to them, and you will then gain greater access to resources and can build armies

and other such things. (we will obviously work out the details once we start actually developing

this.) In addition to all this, pre-existing entities in the lore such as the Azellian Republic and the

Human Imperium are factions; that is, they are the same kind of thing as a player clan. This will

hopefully make the word feel incredibly dynamic and malleable, and will certainly open up

incredible roleplay possibilities.

In addition to a faction system, this game will have a strong emphasis on randomly

generated content. I understand this is incredibly ambitious, as randomly generated content is

incredibly hard to do well, but I think it is possible to make this good if we spend enough time on

it. Essentially, you can visit an unlimited amount of randomly generated planets similar to No

Man’s Sky (but hopefully better), and on these planets you can find randomly generated

settlements and factions, and in these you can find randomly generated quest lines and NPCs,

etc. There will also be pre-made content in things like the Azellian Republic, the capitals of the

Republic and the Imperium, etc., but most of the content in the game will be randomly

generated.

You’re probably rolling your eyes right now given how incredibly difficult this would be to

implement, and in fact it is probably literally impossible to make currently with the resources we

currently have. However, as we develop the Kroni trilogy, I’d expect our resources to grow as

we gain more revenue from sales, and in addition to that, our skills and knowledge will also

grow. In fact, I think it would be a good idea to begin thinking about this game now due to its

complexity, and perhaps we should even develop it alongside the Kroni trilogy. As we develop

the Kroni trilogy, we’ll probably also develop a lot of groundwork for this game along the way; for

example, combat systems, weapons, textures and models, maybe even an engine if we decide

to make one, etc. Again, I understand this concept is quite ambitious and even bigger indie





studios probably wouldn’t think to make something like this, but I think it's doable with enough

time.

One more thing I’d like to talk about is Kroni stories outside the games. I have no idea

what we’ll be able to do with regards to what mediums we’ll have the resources for, but there

are a lot of stories I’d like to tell that can’t really be fit into the games. For example, a lot of the

stuff I mentioned in my description of the third Kroni game probably felt kinda out of left field, but

I have many stories locked away in my head that could be explained in content outside of the

games. For example, I think I will eventually write a series of books that will focus on the history

of the humans from now up until the Kroni trilogy. I have no idea what else we would be able to

do in this department, and I’ll admit we should just make a game first before we start thinking

about this kind of stuff. However, as I said before, I still think its a good idea to have a lot of this

stuff in the back of our minds as we develop the first Kroni game. Long term goals will help

motivate us to make and finish a good game, and even though some of these might sound like

pipe dreams, I’d like to have hope that at least some of them can be realized later down the

road.

One final thing I think is important to address is that I understand that many of you

probably have your own story ideas, own game ideas, etc. Because of this, I am willing to

compromise and collaborate and perhaps fuse our ideas together in some capacity. When I

conceived of the universe I wanted Kroni to be set in, I purposely made it open-ended and with

endless possibilities because I knew anyone I collaborated with would have their own ideas. I

really want to hear any feedback or input or thoughts about anything I’ve written in this

document, and I am open to changing most things. However, I also hope that some of the things

I’ve discussed here have interested you, and that Kroni is a game you would be willing to help

me make.
